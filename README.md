# arch_model_petrobras

In this notebook a study presented in Morettin (2006) book "Análise de Séries Temporais" is replicated, in which it is adjusted an ARCH model on the Brazilian's state company Petrobras stock prices. In this study it is possible to identify, through the ARCH model heteroscedasticity, the different moments in which occurred some kind of global financial crisis on the stock market.
